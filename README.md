**Cargo subcommand that makes it easier to use [PGO](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/profile-guided-optimization.html)
and [BOLT](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt) to optimize Rust binaries.**

# Installation
```bash
$ cargo install cargo-pgo
```

You will also need the `llvm-profdata` binary for PGO and `llvm-bolt` and `merge-fdata`
binaries for BOLT.

You can install the PGO helper binary by adding the `llvm-tools-preview` component to your toolchain
with `rustup`:
```bash
$ rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

For BOLT, it's unfortunately more complicated. See [below](#bolt-installation) for BOLT installation
guide.

> BOLT support is currently *experimental*.

## PGO/BOLT workflow
It is important to understand the workflow of using feedback-directed optimizations. Put simply, it
consists of three general steps:

1) **Build binary with instrumentation**
    - Perform a special build of your executable which will add additional instrumentation code to it.
2) **Gather performance profiles**
    - Run your instrumented binary on representative workloads. The binary will generate profile files
    on disk which will be then used to optimize the binary.
    - Try to gather as much data as possible. Ideally, run your binary for at least a minute or more.
3) **Build an optimized binary using generated profiles**
    - The compiler will use the generated profiles to build an optimized version of your binary.
    - The binary will be optimized with respect to the profiled workloads. If you execute it on a
    substantially different workload, the optimizations might not work (or they might even make your
    binary slower!).

## Example

# **Usage**
Before you start to optimize your binaries, you should first check if your environment is set up
correctly, at least for PGO (BOLT is more complicated). You can do that using the `info` command:
```bash
$ cargo pgo info
```

## PGO
`cargo-pgo` provides subcommands that wrap common Cargo commands. It will automatically add
`--release` to wrapped commands where it is applicable, since it doesn't really make sense to perform
PGO on debug builds.

### Generating the profiles
First, you need to generate the PGO profiles by performing an *instrumented* build.
You can currently do that in several ways. The most generic command for creating an instrumented
artifact is `cargo pgo instrument`:

```bash
$ cargo pgo instrument [<command>] -- [cargo-args]
```

The `command` specifies what command will be executed by `cargo`. It is optional and by default it
is set to `build`. You can pass additional arguments for `cargo` after `--`.

There are several ways of producing the profiles:

- **Building a binary**
    ```bash
    $ cargo pgo build
    # or
    $ cargo pgo instrument build
    ```

    This is the simplest and recommended approach. You build an instrumented binary and then run it
    on some workloads. Note that the binary will be located at `<target-dir>/<target-triple>/release/<binary-name>`.

- **Running an instrumented program**
    ```bash
    $ cargo pgo run
    # or
    $ cargo pgo instrument run
    ```

    You can also directly execute an instrumented binary with the `cargo pgo run` command,
    which is a shortcut for `cargo pgo instrument run`. This command will instrument the binary and
    then execute it right away.

- **Run instrumented tests**
    ```bash
    $ cargo pgo test
    # or
    $ cargo pgo instrument test
    ```
    In this case the profiles will be generated by test execution. Note that unless your test suite
    is really comprehensive, it might be better to create a binary and run it on some specific
    workloads instead.

### Building an optimized binary
Once you have generated some profiles, you can execute `cargo pgo optimize` to build an optimized
version of your binary.

## BOLT
Using BOLT with `cargo-pgo` is similar to using PGO, however you have to [build](#bolt-installation)
BOLT manually and support for it is currently in an experimental stage.

BOLT is not supported directly by `rustc`, so the instrumentation and optimization commands are not
directly applied to binaries built by `rustc`. Instead, `cargo-pgo` creates additional binaries that
you have to use for gathering profiles and executing the optimized code.

### Generating the profiles
First, you need to generate the BOLT profiles. To do that, execute the following command:
```bash
$ cargo pgo bolt build
```
The instrumented binary will be located at `<target-dir>/<target-triple>/release/<binary-name>-bolt-instrumented`.
Execute it on several workloads to gather as much data as possible.

Note that for BOLT, the profile gathering step is optional. You can also simply run the optimization
step (see below) without any profiles, although it will probably not have a large effect.

### Building an optimized binary
Once you have generated some profiles, you can execute `cargo pgo bolt optimize` to build an
optimized version of your binary. The optimized binary will be named `<binary-name>-bolt-optimized`.

## BOLT + PGO
Yes, BOLT and PGO can even be combined :) To do that, you should first generate PGO profiles and
then use BOLT on already PGO optimized binaries. You can do that using the `--with-pgo` flag:

```bash
# Build PGO instrumented binary
$ cargo pgo build
# Run binary to gather PGO profiles
$ ./target/.../<binary>
# Build BOLT instrumented binary using PGO profiles
$ cargo pgo bolt build --with-pgo
# Run binary to gather BOLT profiles
$ ./target/.../<binary>-bolt-instrumented
# Optimize a PGO-optimized binary with BOLT
$ cargo pgo bolt optimize --with-pgo
```

### BOLT installation
Here's a short guide how to compile LLVM with BOLT. You will need a recent compiler, `CMake` and
`ninja`.

1) Download LLVM
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
    $ cd llvm-project 
    ```
2) (Optional) Checkout a stable version, at least 14.0.0
    ```bash
    $ git checkout llvmorg-14.0.5
    ```
   Note that BOLT is being actively fixed, so a `trunk` version of LLVM might actually work better.
3) Prepare the build
    ```bash
    $ cmake -S llvm -B build -G ninja \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PWD}/llvm-install \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld;compiler-rt;bolt"
    ```
4) Compile LLVM with BOLT
    ```bash
    $ cd build
    $ ninja
    $ ninja install 
    ```
    The built files should be located at `<llvm-dir>/llvm-install/bin`. You should add this directory
    to `$PATH` to make BOLT usable with `cargo-pgo`.

# Related work
- [cargo-pgo](https://github.com/vadimcn/cargo-pgo) I basically independently reimplemented this
crate. It uses an almost identical approach, but doesn't support BOLT. It's not maintained
anymore, I got a permission from its author to (re)use its name.
